## Instructions 
- Download this template => https://codesandbox.io/s/word-censor-4doxt?from-embed=&file=/index.js 
- Do not use Codesanbox to code your solution 
- Use the provided array as an input 
- Create a function that censors the text input 
- print out the censored text 

## Tips 
- Remember that functions should do only one thing very well 
- Think of how you can make your code readable by using functions Challenge 1 Together with the new censored version, return a count of how many words were censored in the original text. 

## Challenge 2** 
Instead of using hard-coded inputs, use prompts to grab:
